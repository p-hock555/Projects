The gitint class that I implemented acts like a the Git tool that we use with
github and committing our work to the cloud. There are functions within the
gitint class that allows us to do almost everything we can do with github and git.
There includes a create file function, add file, edit file, commit, display, difference,
and checkout commands that allow us to play with git and the file system we use.
