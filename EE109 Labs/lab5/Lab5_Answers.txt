			      Lab 5 - Number Lock

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) To ensure a date appears in the format: MM/DD, what snprintf()
formatting string could be used to ensure dates like 6/9 are generated in a
character buffer as 06/09.

	char buf[17];
	int m = 6; d = 9;
	snprintf(buf, 17, %02d/%02d, m, d);


2. (1 point) Bobby Bruin wants to add a secret code to the lock where the user can go directly from state S0 to the unlocked state S4 by pressing both buttons at the same time.  Tammy Trojan, thinking about the execution speed of the processor, says this can't be done, at least not reliably. What is her reason for thinking so?

			   Operation of the Circuit

Please record a video of you demonstrating the operation of the circuit
that shows the following aspects of the combination lock on the LCD.

1. The correct sequence (B-A-A-B) takes it through states S1, S2, and S3 to S4
and then indicates that it is unlocked.

2. Pressing a button (either one) in S4 returns to S0.

3. Incorrect sequence A-A-A goes to S0.

4. Incorrect sequence B-B-B goes to S1.

5. Incorrect sequence B-A-B goes to S1.

6. Incorrect sequence B-A-A-A goes to S0.

7. Demonstrate pressing the button for a longer time still only counts as one
button press.  Show by pressing B to go to S1, and then holding down A for a
few seconds before releasing.  This should only take it to the next state, S2.
