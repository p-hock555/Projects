			   Lab 8 - Digital Stopwatch

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.

1. (2 points) Review the conceptual operation of a timer interrupt.

  a. For a 16-bit timer with clock frequency of 16MHz (like the Arduino) and
  prescalar of 64, how much time corresponds to a timer value of 2000?

  .008 seconds

  b. With a clock frequency of 16MHz and prescalar of 8, what is the longest
  amount of time we can track with an 8-bit hardware timer.



2. (2 points) We want you to feel comfortable reading documentation to
understand the operation of a device. To that end, open the ATmega328/P
datasheet linked on our website from the Tools and Links Page. The Timer we
have used also has the ability to make an output pin turn ON (set), OFF
(clear), or Toggle when the timer reaches the OCR1A value (i.e. in addition to
generating an interrupt, the hardware can automatically toggle or turn an
output on or off). By searching the data sheet and using the information in
section 20.14.1 (especially table 20-3) answer the following questions:

  a. Which two pins can TIMER 1 (the 16-bit) timer control (i.e. what pins are
  associated with OC1A and OC1B)?

The COM1A[1:0] and COM1B[1:0] control the Output Compare pins (OC1A and OC1B respectively)
behavior





  b. Describe what those pins would do when the timer reached the OCR1A value
  if during initialization we used the statement TCCR1A |= 0x60; (Note: The PDF
  register description of TCCR1A is a bit unclear: bit 7:6 corresponds to
  COM1A1,COM1A0 and bit 5:4 corresponds to COM1B1,COM1B0).

			   Operation of the Circuit

Please record a video of you demonstrating the operation of the circuit that
shows the following aspects of the stopwatch operating.

1.  Show the splash screen at the start that shows your name.

2.  Count should be initialized to 0.0 when the program starts.

3.  Pressing the Start/Stop button starts the timing.  When it's running
pressing Start/Stop button stops the timing.  Demonstrate the start/stop action
twice.

4.  Start it timing and let it run for at least 10 seconds to show that the
timing rate is corret.

5.  When running, pressing the Lab/Reset button freezes the display.  Leave it
in this mode for a few seconds and then show that pressing a button will
unfreeze he display and the display count will update to the correct value.

6.  When the timing has been stopped, pressing the Lap/Reset button resets the
time to 0.0 seconds.
