			   Operation of the Circuit

Please record a video of you demonstrating the operation of the circuit that
shows the following aspects of the thermostat operating.

1.  Splash screen with your name shown at start

2.  Buttons select and indicate high/low adjustment

3.  Rotary encoder adjusts selected temperature

4.  Low threshold does not go above high threshold and high threshold does
    not go below low threshold

5.  Threshold values stored in EEPROM and retrieved when Arduino restarted

6.  Temperature sensor responds to temperature changes, displays temperature
    with 0.1 degree Fahrenheit precision

7.  Heating and cooling LEDs respond correctly as temperature changes
