This is my first game that I coded in Python. It is similr to Galaga, where the player has to shoot and avoid other enemy ships in order to get to the next level
and win the game. I followed along a youtube tutorial to get more familiar with coding in Python and learning about the packages that Python offers. The code is from Tech With Tim on his Youtube channel.
