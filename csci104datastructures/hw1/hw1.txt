Git Quiz:

Part (a)
3. Terminal (Mac or Linux)

Part (b)
1. git add hw1q2b.cpp
2. git log

Part (c)
1. When we add files, this stages them or gets them ready to be committed.
Once we add, we can commit, but we need to add -m "message" for the files to actually be saved locally.
If we do not add a message, git will prompt the user for a message using the editor we configured.

Rational Review:

1. yes, if the left side of the operator is the class we are in, then we can do this.
2. yes, we use the friend declaration when we want to access the data inside a class, but
do not need it as a member function. For this, we need a left hand and right hand side still.
3. no, we would need it to be either a friend function or a member function or else the program
will not compile.

Reversi Review:

1. the ostream operator function needs to be a friend function, because it needs to access
the private data members of the class.
2. The board class.
